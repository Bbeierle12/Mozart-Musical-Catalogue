            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="biography">
                <p>Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (1678-1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, and Catholic priest. Born in Venice, he was ordained in 1703 but ceased celebrating Mass shortly after due to health reasons. His distinctive red hair earned him the nickname "Il Prete Rosso" (The Red Priest).</p>

                <p>Vivaldi spent most of his career at the <em>Ospedale della Pietà</em>, a home for abandoned children where he taught violin and composed music for the all-female music ensemble. The talented students performed his compositions in concerts that attracted visitors from across Europe. This unique environment allowed Vivaldi to experiment with innovative instrumental combinations and virtuosic techniques.</p>

                <p>He is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, known particularly for his concertos. His most famous work, <em>The Four Seasons</em>, is among the most popular pieces of Baroque music and pioneered programmatic music—compositions that tell stories or depict scenes. Vivaldi composed over 500 concertos, establishing the three-movement fast-slow-fast structure and ritornello form that became standard.</p>

                <p>His music was highly influential on Johann Sebastian Bach, who transcribed several of Vivaldi's concertos for keyboard instruments. Despite international fame during his lifetime, Vivaldi died in poverty in Vienna in 1741 and was buried in a simple grave. His music was largely forgotten until the 20th century revival of interest in Baroque music.</p>

            <h2>The Four Seasons (Le quattro stagioni)</h2>
            <p>The Four Seasons is a set of four violin concertos from the larger collection <em>Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione</em> (The Contest between Harmony and Invention), Op. 8, published in 1725. These revolutionary works are among the earliest and most detailed examples of program music—compositions that tell stories.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>About The Four Seasons</h4>
                <p>Each concerto is accompanied by a sonnet (possibly written by Vivaldi himself) that describes the scenes depicted in the music. The sonnets are divided into three parts, corresponding to the three movements of each concerto. Vivaldi went further by indicating specific passages in the music that illustrate particular lines of the sonnets.</p>
