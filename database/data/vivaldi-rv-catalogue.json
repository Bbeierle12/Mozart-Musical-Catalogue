    "biography": "Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, and Catholic priest. Born in Venice, he was ordained in 1703 but ceased celebrating Mass shortly after due to health reasons. Vivaldi spent most of his career at the Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandoned children where he taught violin and composed music for the all-female music ensemble. He is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, known particularly for his concertos. His most famous work, The Four Seasons, is among the most popular pieces of Baroque music. Vivaldi composed over 500 concertos, along with numerous operas, sacred choral works, and chamber music. His music was highly influential on Johann Sebastian Bach and other composers. Despite his fame during his lifetime, Vivaldi died in poverty in Vienna in 1741 and was largely forgotten until the 20th century revival of interest in Baroque music.",
